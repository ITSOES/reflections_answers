What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing my repository sets up my git for the first time.  This is so git knows what is being commited to one project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area add another layer of confirmation and control over what exactly you want to commit. The staging area is only a prelude to a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

To see which files are going to be in the commit.
