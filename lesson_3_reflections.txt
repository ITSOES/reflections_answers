When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want security, or if I want to share and collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So my files don't change while I'm working on them ruining everything.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are Git clones that GitHub makes for you and is able to reference the original as the source. Regular clones allow me to make changes locally on my machine.  Branches are for making different changes whose history I would want to track separately.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It makes it easier to tell what changes haven't been pushed yet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use Dropbox.  It has been fairly easy to send files and changes automatically.  The merit of doing it with GitHub is the ability to branch away and merge later.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Making changes in a separate branch while master maintains a working version of my project means I can go ahead and break the project on the new branch without affecting what works.  The only bad thing doing it that way is the hassle merging the branches later, especislly if the master has new commits.
