How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Because of the Psychology that was cited in the Instructor notes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Troubleshooting becomes easier when I can cross-reference what has been changed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Git forces all commits to be meaningful, which makes it far easier to trace the history of the project and revert if needed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is about tracking and sharing coding projects.  Files in such a project are often integral with each other in terms of function.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will show you the entire history of commits. git diff allows you to compare 2 git ids that you can get from git log.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because it's a free license to break the project without losing progress.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I only currently want to use Git to track changes and ideas for my code that I make to complete Udacity's courses.
